SIRI is an IoT + AI-powered closed-loop system designed to revolutionize tissue engineering by enabling real-time monitoring, intelligent analytics, and adaptive environmental control. The system uses IoT sensors to continuously track critical environmental parameters, while machine learning algorithms predict tissue growth patterns and detect potential failures.
When anomalies are detected, automated feedback loops adjust environmental conditions instantly, ensuring optimal tissue development. This approach reduces failure rates, increases success rates, and delivers predictable, reliable, and scalable outcomes in tissue engineering.
